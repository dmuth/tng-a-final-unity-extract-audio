# Extract Audio Files from Star Trek: The Next Generation: A Final Unity

I'm a big fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, including their 1996 game: [A Final Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_%E2%80%93_A_Final_Unity).

Awhile ago, I found [this neat repo](https://github.com/discully/afinalunity) which can be used to
extract audio files from the game, but only one at a time.  Well, I want *all* the audio files,
so I built this repo out to make that possible.

## Usage

(I'll fill this in as soon as I'm done with the repo!)
